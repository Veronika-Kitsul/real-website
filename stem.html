                <p>STEM Research Fellowship is a 10-months long program at St. Mark's School that one applies to with an aim to get help in conducting an independent STEM Research. I am doing the program in 2021-2022 school year. My project will be something
                    in the realm in Cryptography, the science of communication security.
                </p>

                <h4 id="initial">INITIAL PLAN</h4>
                <p>Chaos Theory was discoverec by Lorenz in 1960s when he studied weather patterns. Lorenz noticed that starting with slightly different initial conditions totally changed how the patterns developed and one could not predict in what direction
                    would it move. That is why synoptics are not able to predict weather with a 100% precision — it is chaotical. Another famous example of the Chaos Theory is the Butterfly Effect — butterfly's fly in Brasil can cause a rainstorm in China,
                    though this is a bit exagerrated, it gives a good understanding of the concept of Chaos Theory. Because Chaos is so unpredictable, there were thoughts of using it in Cryptography to obtain truly random encryption of messages that are
                    believed to be 100% unhackable.</p>

                <h4 id="summer">SUMMER WORK</h4>
                <p>Every STEM Fellow does summer work before the fall they start their project. My summer work consisted of several things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research Papers
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
                            <li style="margin-left:2em"></li>

                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>Linear Algebra class</li>
                    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
                        <li style="margin-left:2em">Papers on Chaos Theory in Cryptography that I read required decent understanding of very high-level math and physics, especially electronics. Therefore, I took on Linear Algebra course at Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies to be more
                            comfortable with the math notation and concepts mentioned in the research papers. </li>
                    </ol>

                    <li>Quantum Computing Online-School
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
                            <li style="margin-left:2em">I took a Quantum Computing course to introduce myself to the field. We talked about the very basics of the sphere, how Quantum is different from Classical, and also touched upon Cryptography. I learned about Grover's Algorithm,
                                Quantum Key Distribution, and also some of the hybrid algorithms (ones that use both quantum and classical computers in their work).</li>

                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
                            <li style="margin-left:2em">Did Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Sciences research courses as part of a summer school. Learned to frame research papers, read them and dissect them, how to give efficient presentations and create materials for them,
                                how to reach out for help, and how to leverage data science and machine learning for research. I've also learned a completely new computer language on a fairly high level and can work with data sets through Python libraries,
                                as well as use statistics to analyse the results and conduct a data science research.</li>

                <p>
                    I've identified some keywords for my research project: #cryptography #security #internet_of_things
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have read the guides Ms. Lohwater posted for the Massachussets Science and Engineering Fair. Have printed out all of my summer articles and summaries and nicely organized them in a binder. Last week's meeting with Mr. Bauer was not much talking but we
                    did generate a nice idea of creating a 3D visualization of 2D boards with a source of light and computer simulations. Now I am thinking of looking for articles on this topic.
                </p>
                <p>Read Luc Coté's paper on Privacy Vulnerabilities within IoT Device Traffic. A lot of useful information to also make me realize that I need to read more information about tech security in general. One possible way I might take on is to
                    create a Machine Learning model of traffic masking to automize Luc's work. Mr. Bauer suggested I talk to Luc and hear what does he have to say, and if he worked on it after the Fellowship in any way. I can also try talking to Mr. Host
                    and asking how am I going to collect so much traffic. One way is for me to collect it from the devices I would test but it's going to take too much time, so it would be easier to find open source traffic or ask if we can extract if
                    from the school's network (which is not a good way to do it, I believe).</p>
                <p>Now I would need to ask Jocelym if her brother would be willing to talk to me about the project; read much more about security; work on Cryptography I course. </p>
                <ul>TO-DOs:
                    <li>Work on Cryptography I</li>
                    <li>Read more articles in the resourceses database</li>
                    <li>Update website on summer articles</li>
                    <li>Articles on 3D simulations</li>
                </ul>
