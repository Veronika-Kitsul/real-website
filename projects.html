                    <h4>CRUELTY FREE SOCIAL MEDIA BOT "TurBOTa"</h4>
                    <p>
                        After researching a tool to help people find information about cruelty free brands, me and my friend Polly realized there is no place you would go to search for it as a Ukrainian looking for details on animal testing in local brands. So as a team of enthusiasts
                        from eco-NGO "ESMU," we decided to make one! To speak to our audience, we've chosen to publish an automated bot on of the most popular Ukrainian social media websites — Telegram — so it's convenient to use with no need to download
                        additional apps or go searching online. Just text our bot a brand you are looking for and it will immediately text you back with whether this brand is cruelty free or not, and if it is, we also try to provide if it's vegan or not.
                        If the brand is not cruelty free, you may chose to see similar "good" brands, and the bot will ask you back what kind of specific product you are most interested about (for example, if your first message was Nivea, then it will
                        ask you whether you are looking for a hair care product or maybe a deodorant) and send back a list with about 10-15 other options you might consider. I am leading the team of eight teenagers who are excited to work for it for already
                        1.5 years.

                    <h4>SOLVING THE KNAPSACK PROBLEM WITH VARIATIONAL QUANTUM EIGENSOLVER ALGORITHM</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Knapsack Problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the
                        total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation
                        where the decision makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively. VQE is a hybrid algorithm that allows to combine classical computer and quantum one to
                        get better outputs than each of them is able to provide separately. The project is implemented through the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit Python library for quantum computing.

                    <h4>GROVER'S SEARCH ALGORITHM FOR TWO QUBITS</h4>
                    <p>
                        Grover’s Search Algorithm is a quantum algorithm that searches through unordered data. The algorithm, however, like all quantum, does not output the location with 100% precision but gives a very high probability of finding the element in a certain position.
                        It’s proven that Grover’s Search is √X faster than classical computer, where X is the number of elements in the database. The project is implemented through the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit Python library for quantum computing.

                    <h4>BOUNCY GAME WITH JAVA GRAPHICS</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is a simple Bouncy Game on Java. At the start of the game you are given a ball on a petal and several blocks up above that you have to break through. The ball will automatically start bouncing back and forth, and once it hits any of the blocks --
                        they pop. On the way back, however, it's your job to catch the ball with the petal. Once the ball touches the ground -- game is over. You win if you hit all the blocks and don't let the ball touch the ground. To run the game, download
                        this repository from Github, and run "Bouncy.java" file to begin. All the other files are supplementary classes used to implement the game. Changing any of the files may result in a broken game. The game is implemented using some
                        Java Graphics, classes, and inheritance.
